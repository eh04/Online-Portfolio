    <p>I am Elizabeth Haan. I am a sophomore at Amador Valley High School. Last year I completed ASL 1, Biology and Geometry. Next year I am looking forward to taking Chemistry and Algebra II on FLEXAcademy and ASL 2 at Las Positas Community College. I am also an avid dancer and have been dancing for 11 years. I recently got my pointe shoes and have been working hard ever since. I also enjoy reading. I have read many books and am finishing a series called the I am Number Four Series.
  </p>
  <p>Last year I took part in the Get Set program at Amador. I went to one workshop and on one field trip. At the workshop, I learned how to manufacture a light-up display, which I got to take home. I learned about 3D printing,how to connect wires with soldering, and much more. On the field trip, we went to Stryker Neurovascular and learned how they made the Trevo Stent Retriever. We also learned how nearby Stryker Endoscopy helps athletes in sports. We did a Round Robin, where we learned about the different branches of each company and how they worked together.
  </p>
  <p>When I go to college, I plan to major in Biology or ASL. I will continue on to either go to Las Positas and then transfer to a University of California, or I will go straight to a UC. I really enjoyed ASL and Biology last year, and look forward to continuing on in those areas. I really want to persevere in these areas in the future and want work hard to get there.

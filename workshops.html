    <p> I have participated in many STEM programs. Expanding Your Horizons is one of them. I have gone three years in a row. Last year was my last year, but I hope to volunteer in the future. Every year I also went to a career fair and learned about different jobs in STEM. The first year I participated in workshops called, DIY Projector and Reversing your Tastebuds. I learned how to make a projector with cardboard, rubber bands and a lense. I also learned how your taste buds work and how miracle berries affect them. The second year I participated in workshops called, Help Solve a Cyber Crime and Soft Circuits. I learned how to look into different files to find out who commited the crime. I also learned how to sew a monster with conductive thread. Last year I went to two workshops called Amazing Everyday Chemistry and Wild STEM Magic. I learned how to experiment and see how much water a diaper could hold. I also learned how to use science to do magic tricks. I really enjoyed Expanding Your Horizons and learned how I can contribute to the STEM community.

      Another program I participated in is the Get Set program at Amador Valley High School. I went on one field trip and to one workshop with Get Set. At the workshop I learned about soldering, 3D printing, manufacturing and circuits. On the field trip I learned what it is like to work at Stryker Neurovascular and Stryker Endoscopy. I also learned how they help and benefit other people. During Get Set I learned a lot and hope to participate again in the future.
